<h2>Why Ivacy is included</h2>
<p>
  Ivacy often shows up in “cheap VPN” lists, especially with long-term discounts. We tested it with a simple goal: <strong>how usable is it at a low price point?</strong>
</p>

<h2>Onboarding & first-time feel</h2>
<p>
  The client is traditional and functional. Setup and connection are straightforward, but the overall polish and “it just works” factor is closer to a budget product.
</p>

<h2>Performance in varied network conditions</h2>
<p>
  In practice, stability depends a lot on which server you choose and the time of day. During our use, it behaves more like a <strong>backup option</strong> than a primary daily VPN.
</p>

<h2>Scenario notes</h2>

<h3>General browsing</h3>
<p>
  Works for basic access, but may require switching servers more often.
</p>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>
  Streaming “support” is inconsistent in real use. If streaming is your main goal, you’ll likely want a more reliable provider.
</p>

<h2>Pros & trade-offs</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very low long-term pricing during promos</li>
  <li>Core VPN features are present</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stability is inconsistent</li>
  <li>Not ideal as a long-term primary VPN</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Ivacy is best for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very budget-sensitive users</li>
  <li>Backup / secondary usage</li>
</ul>
