<h2>Why we tested NordVPN</h2>
<p>
  For cross-border SaaS, developer docs, online courses, and large file sync, the core requirement is simple: <strong>stable sessions</strong> and <strong>fewer unexpected drops</strong>.
  NordVPN is one of the most widely used consumer VPN brands, so we tested it as a mainstream baseline.
</p>

<h2>Setup & first-time experience</h2>
<p>
  Installation is straightforward on Windows/macOS and mobile. The default experience is relatively beginner-friendly: you can connect quickly with recommended settings and refine nodes/protocols later.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast onboarding:</strong> quick install and login</li>
  <li><strong>Good defaults:</strong> fewer manual adjustments for most users</li>
  <li><strong>Clean UI:</strong> key features are easy to find</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-world usage notes</h2>

<h3>Streaming & media</h3>
<p>
  For long playback sessions, node quality and congestion matter more than a single speed test. In our usage, NordVPN generally maintains stable playback when using recommended or popular nodes.
</p>

<h3>AI tools, SaaS, and API access</h3>
<p>
  When using AI tools and overseas services, the main pain point is session interruption and repeated verification. NordVPN performs well in keeping longer sessions stable, especially compared to some budget options.
</p>

<h3>Public Wi‑Fi (cafes / airports / hotels)</h3>
<p>
  For public networks, a VPN is primarily a safety layer. Features like a kill switch help reduce accidental exposure during disconnects.
</p>

<h2>Limitations to know</h2>
<p>
  Like any VPN, there is no guarantee of perfect connectivity in all conditions. Some nodes can be unstable at certain times, and you may need to switch nodes or protocols.
</p>

<h2>Refund policy (what to expect)</h2>
<p>
  NordVPN typically offers a <strong>30‑day refund</strong> (see the official policy for the latest terms). In practice, the process is usually standard for mainstream providers.
</p>

<h2>Who NordVPN is best for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users who want a <strong>safer mainstream choice</strong></li>
  <li>Cross-border SaaS / developer tool users who value stability</li>
  <li>People who prefer mature apps over endless tweaking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who might want to look elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If your priority is the <strong>lowest long-term cost</strong>, consider PureVPN</li>
  <li>If you need <strong>many devices</strong> under one plan, consider Surfshark</li>
  <li>If you prioritize <strong>privacy & transparency</strong> above all, consider Proton VPN</li>
</ul>
