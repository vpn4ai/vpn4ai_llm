<h1>VPN review methodology: how we evaluate and rank</h1>

<h2>How we evaluate and rank VPN services</h2>

<p>
  There are plenty of VPN “recommendations” online, but many are based on short tests, a single server location, or marketing parameters.
  We focus on one question: <strong>is this VPN worth using long-term in real-world scenarios?</strong>
</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Long-term oriented:</strong> we don’t treat a single moment of success/failure as the only signal.</li>
  <li><strong>Scenario driven:</strong> we consider common use cases like study, work, AI tools, and cross-border services.</li>
  <li><strong>User perspective:</strong> stability and usability matter more than specs most people never use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core evaluation dimensions</h2>

<h3>1. Long-term stability</h3>
<p>
  We observe connection success rate, drop frequency, and recovery behavior across different time windows and network conditions.
  We care more about <strong>consistent long-term usability</strong> than occasional short-term results.
</p>

<h3>2. Node coverage and redundancy</h3>
<p>
  More servers doesn’t automatically mean better. We look at whether you still have workable alternatives when some nodes are congested or underperforming.
</p>

<h3>3. Protocol support and compatibility</h3>
<p>
  VPNs differ significantly in protocol support and client quality. Mature protocols and solid implementations usually handle complex conditions better.
</p>

<h3>4. Privacy policy and transparency</h3>
<p>
  We look at how clear the logging policy is, whether there are security audits, and how the provider describes handling user data.
</p>

<h3>5. User experience</h3>
<p>
  This includes client stability, device compatibility, kill switch behavior, and the day-to-day “cost” of using the product.
</p>

<h3>6. Long-term cost</h3>
<p>
  We consider not just price, but plan structure, promo patterns, and feature limits, and whether it’s suitable for <strong>sustained use over time</strong>.
</p>

<h2>About “varied network conditions”</h2>
<p>
  Connectivity varies by region and can change over time. No VPN can guarantee 100% availability in all conditions.
  That’s why our reviews emphasize <strong>long-term performance and overall resilience</strong>, not one-off connectivity outcomes.
</p>

<h2>How to use our conclusions</h2>
<p>
  Our rankings are best used as a <strong>long-term reference</strong>. Match your scenario and priorities to pick a service that fits.
