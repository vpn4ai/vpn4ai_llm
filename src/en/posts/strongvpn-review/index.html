<h2>Why we tested StrongVPN</h2>
<p>
  StrongVPN is a long-running provider with a reputation for being stable and straightforward. It’s often described as “does the job” rather than “feature-packed”.
</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>
  The client feels traditional. There are no major weaknesses, but also fewer standout features. The overall experience is: it won’t bother you much.
</p>

<h2>Performance in varied network conditions</h2>
<p>
  In more complex conditions, stability and recovery may not be as strong as the most mainstream providers. It can be more suitable in relatively relaxed conditions.
</p>

<h2>Who StrongVPN is best for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users who prefer a traditional VPN experience</li>
  <li>Users who don’t need many new features</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who might want to look elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users who require stronger stability and recovery in complex conditions</li>
</ul>
