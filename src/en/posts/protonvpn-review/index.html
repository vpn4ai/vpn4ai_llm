<h2>Why we tested Proton VPN</h2>
<p>
  Proton VPN is known for its privacy-oriented positioning and a more “security-minded” product philosophy. That makes it a strong candidate for users who care about <strong>privacy policy clarity</strong> and <strong>security features</strong>.
</p>

<h2>First-time experience</h2>
<p>
  Compared with some one-click VPNs, Proton VPN tends to expose more security-related options and terminology, but the UI remains relatively clean. It’s still approachable for most users, though it may feel less “automatic”.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for common protocols (e.g., WireGuard / OpenVPN)</li>
  <li>Security features such as kill switch and leak protection</li>
  <li>Some advanced features may depend on plan level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stability under varied network conditions</h2>
<p>
  Proton VPN does not primarily optimize for “maximum speed” or “instant unblocking”. Its strength is often in <strong>steady sessions</strong> and a conservative security posture. For longer work sessions, this can be a good trade.
</p>

<h2>Real-world scenarios</h2>

<h3>Work & study</h3>
<p>
  For long sessions (remote dashboards, documentation, online learning), stability and privacy posture matter. Proton VPN can be a good fit if you value a clearer security narrative.
</p>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>
  Streaming success varies over time and by node. If streaming is your only goal, mainstream “streaming-first” providers may be a better match. Proton VPN is more balanced toward privacy and security.
</p>

<h3>Public Wi‑Fi</h3>
<p>
  For public networks, features like kill switch and leak protection are useful baseline protections.
</p>

<h2>Pros & trade-offs</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong privacy/security positioning</li>
  <li>Good fit for long sessions where stability matters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>May feel less “one-click optimized” for streaming</li>
  <li>Node selection and speeds vary by region and time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Proton VPN is best for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Privacy- and security-minded users</li>
  <li>Users who prefer transparency and security features over the lowest price</li>
  <li>People who can spend a bit more time picking nodes for their scenarios</li>
</ul>
